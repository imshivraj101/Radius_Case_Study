      To design a platform that fosters meaningful social interaction, I conducted
      an in-depth analysis of leading social platformsâ€”Instagram, Snapchat,
      Discord, Reddit, Google+, and Facebook. The goal was to understand why
      users increasingly feel disconnected, despite being more digitally
      connected than ever.
